# Spotify Top 1000 in 2024
For this project, I cleaned data and performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the top 1000 tracks on Spotify for 2024. 

I used SQL to clean and transform raw streaming data in MySQL by standardizing formats, removing duplicates, converting data types, and creating a staging table to isolate and analyze Spotify-specific metrics for 2024â€™s most streamed songs. Then, analyzed artist performance, track popularity, playlist metrics, and temporal trends to uncover insights on music release strategies, streaming behavior, and content patterns using advanced SQL queries.
