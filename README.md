# Finding the formula to charting on Spotify
### Overview

For this project, I cleaned data and performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the top 1000 tracks on Spotify for 2024. 

I used SQL to clean and transform raw streaming data in MySQL by standardizing formats, removing duplicates, converting data types, and creating a staging table to isolate and analyze Spotify-specific metrics for 2024â€™s most streamed songs. Then, analyzed artist performance, track popularity, playlist metrics, and temporal trends to uncover insights on music release strategies, streaming behavior, and content patterns using advanced SQL queries.

### Key Insights and Findings

There are more clean tracks in the top 1000 than explicit tracks.
- Explicit: 41.9%	
- Clean: 58.1%

Tracks released in the previous year (2023) make up the majority of the tracks in the top 1000. It usually takes about a year to reach the top 1000.

The most popular months to release music are May, April, March, and January. This is probably due to the preparation for festival and concert season (summertime) so artists are releasing new music in the spring. The beginning of the new year is a popular time for music release. This may be due to fewer major artists releasing music at this time and people tend to search for new music to listen to at the beginning of the year.

The most popular weekday to release music is Friday, followed by Thursday. Friday has been deemed "Global Release Day" by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), more new music are being discovered on streaming services on Fridays, and most users anticipate new music on Friday. Many people have more free time over the weekend to listen to new music. Many music charts also track weekly sales and streams starting on Fridays.
